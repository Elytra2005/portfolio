# Mahmoud el hajj — Portfolio

A fast, responsive portfolio for showcasing selected work and services.

## Edit content
- Update text in `index.html`.
- Duplicate the `.project-card` in the `#work` section to add projects.
  - Replace image `src` with your screenshot (put files into `assets/images/`).
  - Update title, description, tags, and links.
- Update social links in the footer.

## Theming
- Uses dark by default and respects system preference.
- Toggle theme with the button in the header; preference persists in `localStorage`.

## Develop locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser. For live reload, serve the folder (for example using VS Code Live Server extension).

## Deploy
You can deploy the static site on:
- Netlify — drag-and-drop the folder, or connect a repo.
- GitHub Pages — push to a repo and enable Pages.
- Vercel — import the repo as a static site.

## Assets
- Favicon at `assets/icons/favicon.svg`.
- Add project screenshots to `assets/images/` and reference them in `index.html`.
